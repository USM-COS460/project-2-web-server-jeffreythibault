## My experience with this project

Like with the first project, I was again surprised at the relative simplicity of the technology of these Http servers.
I thought it was pretty interesting that at the base level you have these very simple strings handling requests and responses
on web servers. I spent entirely too much time messing around with them on telnet, and with another program I discovered called
Postman that allows you to clearly parse the content of these requests. I regret choosing Java a little bit due to the sheer
amount of "syntax googling" I felt like I had to do here, but overall it was a good experience for me. I may choose another 
language in the future though.
